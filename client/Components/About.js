            <h2 className="subHeader"> A History of Me </h2>
              <p> I've always had an interest in computers. I still remember playing games on 5 1/4" floppy disks (Damn you Alley Cat, do a better job explaining how you work to 5 year old me) and building my own computer with my brothers' help. Life took me down a non-computer related path at Cornell in sunny Ithaca, followed by living abroad in Israel. However, I soon realized that my favorite part of my jobs were building macros or automating processes. I made the plunge and signed up for Fullstack Academy in 2017, and here we are today. A young (I can still call myself that until I turn 30 in October), aspiring, software developer looking to make an impact in a new and exciting role. </p>

              <p> Outside of being a software developer, I enjoy playing and watching sports. Unfortunately for me, my favorite teams are the NJ Devils (pretty good), Arsenal (not great...), and the NY Giants (woof). </p>
